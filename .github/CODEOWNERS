# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies .md files, only the last rule will be applied.
# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
