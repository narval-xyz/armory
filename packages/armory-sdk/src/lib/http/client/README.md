## Generate HTTP clients

This section describes how to generate HTTP clients for each one of the stack's
servers.

The generate targets uses `openapi-generator-cli` that depends on a running
server hosting the Swagger documentation.

It requires JAVA to be installed so make sure it's installed by running `java -version` in your terminal.

You can install it by running `brew install java` or by downloading it directly from [this website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk22-mac).

```bash
# Start the server
make armory/start/dev
make vault/start/dev

# In another terminal session, run the generate target
make armory-sdk/generate/auth-client
make armory-sdk/generate/vault-client
```

After you generate an HTTP client, run `make armory-sdk/test/type` to ensure
changes in the API are respecting the SDK's internal types.

You can find the make targets in the SDK's [Makefile](./../../../../Makefile).
