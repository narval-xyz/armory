# Basic Signing Example

This is a basic example of using signing a message. It authorizes the signature with an Armory, and then signs with the Vault.

## Prerequisites

As first steps, to get this example up and running you need to:

1- Have your Narval Armory stack up and running:

- authorization server
- policy engine
- vault

2- Configure your policies and user & credential

3- Set your .env file (example in .env.defaults)

## Running

```
npm start
```

Note: this command is for bash; it will load in your .env file.
