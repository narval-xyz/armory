# Policy Engine Setup

## Terminology

- **CEK**: Content Encryption Key. The key used to encrypt client-related data.
- **KEK**: Key Encryption Key. The key used to encrypt engine-related data.
- **MK**: Master Key
- **Data Storage**: The storage system responsible for holding data related to
  clients entities and policies. While Narval doesn't mandate the use of a
  specific storage system like S3 or IPFS, it does require that the data stored
  conforms to Narval's data structure for entities and policies.
- **Database**: The engine's database. It's used to store some of engine's
  configuration, client's encrypted configuration, and encrypted client's data.
- **Engineer**: A persona with high credentials to set up critical software within
  an organization.
- **Admin**: A persona responsible for managing the engine in the organization.
  It can be the same person as the Engineer.

## Provision

Summary of the provision procedure.

```mermaid

  title Provision (via terminal)

  actor Engineer
  participant Engine as Policy Engine
  participant DB as Database

  Engineer ->> Engine: Run provision script
  activate Engine
  Engine ->> Engine: Verify if is the first time provisioning
  alt is first time provisioning
    Engine ->> Engine: Set environment variables and secrets
    Engine ->> Engine: Set up database
    Engine ->> Engine: Run database migration
    Engine ->> Engine: Generate master key (MK)
    Engine ->> Engine: Generate admin API key (AK)
    Engine ->> DB: Write KEK (AES-256) encrypted MK
    Engine ->> DB: Write KEK (AES-256) encrypted AK
    Engine -->> Engineer: Return engine configuration JSON
  else
    Engine -->> Engineer: Prompt Yes/No to re-provision
    deactivate Engine
    Note over Engine: Re-provisioning will overwrite existing data to "factory default".
  end
```

## Sync client data stores

Summary of the procedure to fetch client data. This is used at boot time and
when a new client is onboarded.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  title Fetch client data

  participant Engine
  participant DS as Data Storage
  participant DB as Database

  par
    Engine ->> DS: Read client entity data (ED)
    activate Engine
    Engine ->> DS: Read client entity signature (ES)
    Engine ->> DS: Read client policy data (PD)
    Engine ->> DS: Read client policy signature (PS)
  end
  Engine ->> Engine: Verify signatures
  Engine ->> Engine: Check if client's data changed
  alt signatures are valid and data changed
    Engine ->> DB: Write CEK (AES-256) encrypted client's ED, ES, PD, and PS
    deactivate Engine
  end
```

- To verify if data changed, we compare the stored hashes with the received ones.

## Boot

Summary of the boot procedure.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  title Application boot

  participant Engine
  participant DB as Database
  participant DS as Data Storage

  Engine ->> Engine: Read and validate engine's configuration
  activate Engine
  alt if engine configuration is valid
    Engine ->> DB: Read clients configuration
    loop For each client
      Engine ->> DS: Fetch client data
    end
  else
    Engine ->> Engine: Abort the boot with invalid environment error message
    deactivate Engine
  end
```

## Client onboard

Summary of the procedure to onboard a new client in a live policy engine.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  title client onboard

  actor Admin
  participant Engine as Policy Engine
  participant DB as Database
  participant DS as Data Storage

  Admin ->> Engine: Onboard client request
  activate Engine
  Engine ->> DB: Verify if admin API key exists
  Engine ->> Engine: Generate client signing key pair
  Engine ->> Engine: Generate client API key (TAK)
  Engine ->> DB: Write CEK (AES-256) encrypted client configuration
  Engine ->> DS: Fetch client data
  Engine ->> DB: Write CEK (AES-256) client's data
  Note over DB: Does not fail the onboarding if fetching the client data failed
  Engine -->> Admin: client's UID, sgining public key and TAK
  deactivate Engine
```

- **Onboard client Request**: Requires: Admin API key, client ID, Entity storage
  URL, Entity signature URL, Entity JWKS, Policy storage URL, Policy signature
  URL, Policy JWKS.
- **Content Encryption Key (CEK)**: A unique key made by blending a Master Key
  and a client UID with a process called HMAC Key Derivation Function (HKDF), used
  to encrypt data.
- **Admin Role**: Only an admin can add new clients to the system.
- **Admin API Keys**: The system supports multiple API keys for admins, allowing
  several admins to operate.
- **client's Signing Key**: This key signs evaluation responses, ensuring
  they're genuine and allowing verification by upstream services.
- **client API Key**: Used by clients to authenticate their requests to the
  Policy Engine, ensuring that the requests are legitimate. It's used alongside
  user signed requests.

## Policy publish

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  title Policy publish

  actor Admin
  participant Engine as Policy Engine
  participant DB as Database
  participant FS as File System

  Engine ->> Engine: Sync client policy data store
  Engine ->> DB: Get policy dataset latest version
  Engine ->> Engine: Build Rego bundle
  Engine ->> FS: Temporary save the Rego bundle
```

## Encryption

This section describes the encryption summary used to secure the Policy Engine.

1. **Master Password to Key Encryption Key (KEK) via PBKDF2**: Using PBKDF2
   (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) to derive a Key Encryption Key (KEK)
   from an "encryptor master password" is a standard practice. PBKDF2 is designed
   to make brute-force attacks difficult by using a salt and iterating the hashing
   process many times, thus slowing down the attack attempts.
   1. [node.js crypto built-in implementation](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptopbkdf2password-salt-iterations-keylen-digest-callback)
   2. Master Password is an env secret
2. **Generating an AES-256 Master Key and Encrypting with KEK**: Generating a
   strong AES-256 master key for encryption is a solid choice given AES-256's
   widespread acceptance and strength. Encrypting this master key with the KEK for
   storage is a common approach in hierarchical key management systems, ensuring
   that the master key is not exposed in plaintext.
3. **Deriving a Content Encryption Key (CEK) from the Master Key using HKDF**:
   HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) is designed for deriving additional
   keys from a single master key, which is a suitable method for generating Content
   Encryption Keys (CEKs) from your master key. This step allows for different keys
   to be used for different pieces of content or sessions, enhancing security by
   limiting the scope of each key's usage.

### Notes

- **Secure Handling of Salts, IVs, and Nonces**: Ensure that salts for PBKDF2,
  Initialization Vectors (IVs) for AES encryption, and nonces for HKDF (if
  applicable) are securely generated (cryptographically secure random values) and
  handled properly. Salts and IVs don't need to be kept secret but should be
  unique to prevent various cryptographic attacks.

### AWS KMS encryption

In AWS KMS, the KMS Customer Master Key (CMK) replaces the MK, and then the
derived Data Keys replace the CEK. There is no need for a Master Password or KEK
because the CEK is generated & used within an HSM.

KMS key policies are used to restrict the CMK to the specific EC2 instance. If
using Nitro Enclaves, the CMK Key Policy can be set to match a specific
enclaveâ€™s attestation, effectively locking usage of that key to a single
enclave.
